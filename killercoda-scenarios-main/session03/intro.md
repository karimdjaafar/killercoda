Welcome!

During this courses, we will learn how to manipulate file and folder.

The left panel contains explanations and instructions to run command lines.

Use the right panel to type the command examples, and try as many experiments as you want.

During the course, some Bash commands will be explained. They will be written like `this one` and must be copied identically in the right window. You can be modified them if you want, but you will have to remember the changes afterwards. We therefore advise you to keep the text or value proposed in the example.
