### *head*

You may sometimes want to check just the beginning of a file.

That is what the `head` command does:

```bash
head belebele.bed
```

By default, this command will show you the first 10 lines of a file. 

You can specify the number of lines shown with the option *-n*:

```bash
head -n 15 belebele.bed
``` 

will show you the first 15 lines.


**Question:** Print the first line of the file `belebele.bed`. What is the value of the third column?
