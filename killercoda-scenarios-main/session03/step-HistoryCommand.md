## Some useful commands and tips

- `history` shows all the commands you used so far. An incrementing number is attributed to each of them.
- `!num` where *num* is the command number in history: runs again the corresponding command.
- You can also use <kbd>⬆️</kbd> and <kbd>⬇️</kbd> arrow keys to get the previous (unexecuted) command back and you can edit it as you need.
